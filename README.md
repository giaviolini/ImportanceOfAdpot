### Navigation Bar
1. I continued to practice my skills of how to use the HTML List Element (as illustrated in my Basic-Website Read Me) and how to use this element in combination with CSS to create a more functional navigation bar.  \
2. I learned how to create a hover effect to change the text color when a user hovers over a specific tab.  \
3. To create this I used the ```:hover``` [Psuedo Class](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.aspl) to target the parent page in the nav bar. I labeled my navigation as "top-nav" so to target it in CSS would be ```.top-nav ;hover{...}```  \
4. Then to change the color I added ```text-color: #XXXXXX``` to the Pseudo Class to change the text color, but only when hovered over.
 
### Photo Maps
Photo maps were something I had never heard of before, so I had to watch a few tutorials to understand what was going on. The tutorials suggested using a photo map generator, so I used [Image-Map.net](https://www.image-map.net/)  \
I wanted my photo maps to be clickable and bring you to another page, so it involved linking the pages correctly. Finding the correct way to write the href was a challenge, but it ended up being ```pages/pagetitle.html```. I did not have to use ```.../``` like I had discovered worked well before. This was because the image map already existed on the index page, so it could just go into the pages folder and get the correct page without the ```.../```  to travel through the folder.   \
The generator made it very easy. 
1. I found the picture I wanted to use, uploaded it to the website, and my project's folder
2. Selected what part of the photo I wanted to link the page to
3. Added the correct href for the page to the designated box
4. Generated the Image Map and added the code provided from the generator to the code for my site.
