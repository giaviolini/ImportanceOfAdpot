# Navagations and Photo Maps
## What I learned/practiced
How to fancy-up a navigation bar and photo map

### Navigatation Bar
I continued to practice my skils of how to use lists (as illistrated in Basic-Website readme) and use create more impressive navigation bars with css.  \
I learned how to create a hover so it would change the text color when a user hovered over a specific tab.  \
To create this you can add the ```:hover``` after selecting your nav bar. I labeled mine as top-nav so it would like ```.top-nav ;hover{...}```  \
Then to change the color I simply put ```text-color: #XXXXXX``` to pick up the new text color, but only when hovered over.

### Photo Maps
Photo maps were something I had never heard before, so I had to watch a few tutorials to understand what was going. The tutorials I was used suggested using a photo map generator, so that is what I used.  \
I wanted my photo maps to be clickable and bring you to another page, so it involed linking the pages correctly. Finding the correct way to write the href was a challenge, but it ended up being ```pages/pagetitle.html```. I did not have to use ```.../``` like I had discovered worked well before. This was because the image map already exsisted on the index page, so it could just go into the pages folder and get the correct page without the ```.../```  to travel through the folder.   \
The generator made it very easy. 
1. I found the picture I wanted to use, uploaded to the website and my project's folder
2. Selected what part of the photo I wanted to link the page to
3. Added the correct href for the page to the designated box
4. Generated the Image Map and added it to my code.
